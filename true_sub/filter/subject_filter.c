Write a program that will take one and only one argument s.

Your program will then read from stdin and write all the content read in stdout
except that every occurrence of s must be replaced by '*' (as many as the length
of s). Your program will be tested with random buffer sizes, using a custom read
function. Therefore the buffer being set in your program will be filled with a
different number of chars each new call.

For example:

$>./filter hello
will behave in the same way as:
sed 's/hello/*****/g'

$>./filter abc
will behave in the same way as:
sed 's/abc/***/g'

More generally your program must be the equivalent of the shell script filter.sh
present in this directory (you can compare your program with it).

In case of error during a read or a malloc, you must write "Error: " followed by
the error message in stderr and return 1.

If the program is called without arguments or with an empty argument or with multiple
arguments, it must return 1.

For example this should work:

$> echo 'abcdefaaabdeabcdeabcabcdbc' | ./filter abc | cat -e
def*****de*****dbc$
$> echo 'abbacababac' | ./filter abac | cat -e
abbac****$

$> echo 'ASSASSIN' | ./filter ASS | cat -e
******IN$
